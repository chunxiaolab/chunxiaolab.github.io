            <h2>About Our Lab</h2>
            <p>Chunxiao Li, Ph.D. in Immunology, Head of the Tumor Radiotherapy Laboratory. The main research areas include: (1) investigating the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of local tumor-infiltrating immune cell differentiation to elucidate the immunological mechanisms of tumor development, aiming to identify new targets for tumor immunotherapy; (2) exploring the immunological mechanisms related to how radiotherapy affects the tumor microenvironment, and clarifying optimal strategies for combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy. Relevant findings have been published as first author and corresponding author in internationally renowned academic journals such as Immunity, JHO, Molecular Cancer, Nature Communications, and Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC), and have been selected as ESI's global top 1% "highly cited" papers. Hosted and participated in key research and development programs of the Ministry of Science and Technology, key projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, general projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Youth Fund projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, general projects of the Beijing Natural Science Foundation, and general and special funding projects of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.</p>
